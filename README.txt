Here are the objectives of this learning project:

1) Utilize HDF5 file for saving and loading numerical data.
2) Modularize Python functions and classes for machine learning tasks.
3) Utilize pytorch lightning for training, validation, and testing.
    - Create custom callbacks
    - Checkpointing to save model and test results.
    - Visualize training/validation data using an experiment manager (Weight and Biases, in this case).
4) Create an overall API class that wraps the full pipeline using parsed arguments (CLI commands). 
    - Learn to configure and use .yaml files
